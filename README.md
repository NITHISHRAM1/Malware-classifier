# Malware-classifier
Various Machine Learning methods are investigated and used to investigate how programs are used to build malware or light malware.The datasets are analysed using a variety of models, including decision trees and random forests.Finally,data is subjected to a series of test to determine the pattern's correctness.This study focuses on improvising the malware detection by concentrating on the feature selection Phase.In the implementation of Android malware detection using machine learning,the two primary sources of the feature are static extraction and dynamic extraction.Static features are extracted from the manifest, Dalvik bytecode,native code and other reversed APK files.
